c0llude Inbox Plugin
====================

## What is this for?

Email is 1970's technology, it's unencrypted, and it's easily tracked by government agencies and malicious actors. So we built a flat-file inbox which keeps your messages private.  

How do others send messages to your flat-file inbox? This plugin is a template for a public contact form where anyone can compose a message, enter their contact information, press a button, and it will show up in your inbox instantly, along with the date and time it was received.

## Example Setup

For example, visitors might send you a message at [mywebsite.com/contact-us/](#) ... 
and it will appear at [mywebsite.com/secret-c0llude-install/inbox/](#)

## Modifications

You can add more fields to the form (such as first and last name), add a captcha to prevent spam, or add a section for visitors to send you their public key. The options are unlimited.

## Privacy

As long as your server uses strong TLS encryption (https://), messages sent this way will never leave your server, will never be exposed to government agencies ... in short, your messages will remain in your hands, for your eyes only.
