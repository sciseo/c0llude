# c0llude
c0llude is a self-hosted, flat-file collaboration tool for small teams and activists. Your data belongs to you and your team, not government lawyers and spies. So we built c0llude with privacy from the ground up, under the following principles:

```
**Open Source**
Anyone can view and examine every line of our source code. You'll find that our software never tracks your activity, never phones home, and simply "does what it says on the box".
```

# Quick Install

On a PHP-capable web server, run 
```
git clone https://github.com/neflabs/c0llude
chmod -R 770 c0llude
```
